#### What is INDUSTRIAL-BEATS?

INDUSTRIAL-BEATS is an FM-based drum synth and rhythm generator coded in SuperCollider, inspired by a modular performance by Datachrome - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmkev6NS4E0


#### Why the name "INDUSTRIAL-BEATS"?

The genre explored could fall under the umbrella of "Industrial" or "Electro-Industrial" music.


#### How is it going to work?

The sound of the linked performance is achieved using a mixture of sample playback (kick, hi-hats, snare) and frequency modulated synthesised sounds, all being triggered by a sequencer and with some paramter modulation by the performer.

This project will most certainly employ frequency or phase modulation to create the body of the sound. The sample playback used in the origianl performance could be recreated using the same methods, or through use of subtractive synthesis, or through sample playback.
